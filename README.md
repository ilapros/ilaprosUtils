A bunch of functions in R I find useful - mostly extreme values stuff and things to handle hydrometric data.  

To use this set of functions you will need to run the following in R: 

```r
# if not already installed`
# install.packages("devtools")`
library(devtools)
install_github("ilapros/ilaprosUtils")
library(ilaprosUtils)
```
