Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: "Ilaria Prosdocimi <prosdocimi.ilaria@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: Some Functions I use to handle the Flow/Rainfall data I get. And
    some addition to the ismev package that I find useful (notably, fitting the GLO
    distribution and allowing the inclusion of non-systematic data). Some stuff on
    Lmoments as well - which mostly need lmom to be loaded.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.3)
Imports:
    lmom,
    ismev
