Description: Some Functions I use to handle the Flow/Rainfall Data I get. And
    some addition to the ismev package that I find useful (notably, fitting the
    GLO distribution as well). Some stuff on Lmoments as well - which mostly
    need lmom to be loaded.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.0)
Imports:
    lmom,
    ismev
